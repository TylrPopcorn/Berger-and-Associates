# Berger & Associates

A complete redesign and front-end build named Berger & Associates, originally created in Figma and fully implemented using EJS templating. This project features a clean, modern UI with a fully responsive layout and structured content hierarchy. It showcases the full transformation of a high-fidelity mockup into a functional, production-ready website â€” blending performance, accessibility, and design precision. Key highlights include modular EJS components, optimized layout responsiveness, and attention to user experience across devices.
